    "### Interactive Inverse Dimension Reduction \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements interactive dimension reduction (DR) for exploratory analysis of high-dimensional data.\n",
    "It uses a Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) algorithm with a weighted distance metric. It enables both forward and inverse DR interaction. \n",
    "\n",
    "**MDS** projects high-dimensional data to a 2D scatterplot. A **weighted distance function** with user-specified weights on each dimension enables alternative projections that emphasize different dimensions. An **Inverse-DR** algorithm learns distance function weights for  user-constructed layouts of the data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run All\n",
    "1. Proceed to the interactive plots near the bottom\n",
    "1. There are three kinds of interactions:\n",
    "    1. Select points in the DR plot and click Details to see data values.\n",
    "    1. **Parametric interaction:** Adjust the weight sliders and click Apply to alter the projection plot.\n",
    "    1. **Projection interaction:** Drag points in the projection plot, then click Learn to see learned weights, and click Copy to see the updated projection plot.\n",
    "1. Be patient, its interactive matplotlib in python and Jupyter!\n",
